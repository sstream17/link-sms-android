/**
 * When creating notifications, a single new conversation will never get the group message key on it.
 * This is because it will mess everything up, since it isn't marked as the group summary and a group summary will get
 * dismissed if it only has one item.
 *
 * This will help us know how many notifications should be updated when a new message comes in.
 *
 * If the user's device cannot read the active notifications (along with the group key), then we just re-notify everything
 * This is fine, and how the app usually worked, but with Notification Channels, it doesn't work as well, since we will
 * get spammed with constant notifications.
 *
 * If there is more than 2 new conversations, then all the logic here has already been taken care of.
 * We can just notify the single new conversation and it will be added to the active group notification
 *
 * If there are two new conversations, then there is the possibility that the original (first) notification
 * doesn't have the required group key. This won't work well, because the first and second notification will
 * now be separated, and not grouped. So we need to update the first conversation notification with the group key
 * so that they can both be combined into the notification group.
