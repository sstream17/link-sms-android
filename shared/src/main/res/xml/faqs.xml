    <item question="Why are my GIFs and videos that I send so small?">
        <answer>The majority of carriers enforce a 1 MB size limit on all attachments. This
            unfortunately means that the quality and resolution of content like videos needs to be
            decreased so that it can fit under this limit but still be useful to the recipient.
            Since all of the infrastructure is already in place by carriers to support this, it
            isn't something that I can improve in the app.

    <item question="I'm not able to send MMS messages or group messages, what should I do?">
        <answer>If you send me an email, we can try and troubleshoot possible solutions to the
            problem! I can also get more information this way so that the process can be improved in
            the future.

    <item question="How can I know that my messages are safe and private?">
        <answer>We use strong end-to-end encryption techniques to make sure that your data is kept
            secure and no one but you can access it. This means that on our servers your messages
            are encrypted using your password and even we cannot see what they contain, the only way
            to decrypt them is using your password. In technical terms, we use PBKDF2 to encrypt
            your password and use it as a key to encrypt messages and conversations. The only way to
            decrypt those messages is to then use your password again as the key, along with a few
            other randomly generated numbers called salts.

        <answer>There are multiple options on this screen to talk to a dev from Klinker Apps, you
            can use any of them to talk to us! Probably your best bet is email for a quick response,
            or you can post on Google+ if you'd like other members to also help you out with
            something or get feedback on your ideas.

            ideas! We're a very small team so some things can take time, but we'll try and get
            everything done reasonably quickly, especially when we're also excited about your idea.

    <item question="Where can I report bugs at?">
        <answer>The best place would be either through email or on Google+. Let us know what device
