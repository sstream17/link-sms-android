Pulse is helping you fight spam!<br/><br/>

• The app now has an option (in the Advanced Features menu), for how you want to handle messages that come from a phone number that is not in your contact list. You can choose to mute the conversation or just block it completely!<br/>
• If you receive a group message full of spam, you can now blacklist all of the participants in that conversation with one click!
